# Destiny2-PartyViewer
A party viewer that will display information regarding your current FireTeam in mostly real time. As new gear is equipped and stats change the information panels will update for that user. The goal of this application will be to monitor your fireteam without having to actively inspect them. Sadly fireteam information will have to be manually entered into the application, however some tools will be offered that will ease this pain.
