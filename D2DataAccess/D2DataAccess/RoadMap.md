This document will serve as a way to write down ideas as they come to me to and to maintain a kind of TO-DO list for the core library.

Some first thoughts:
- Need a way to Search for a player
	- This involves loading some basic things about the user
	- Current Level, Current Power, Current Emblem, Current Super Class
	- Things like Account name
	- Gear
		- Primary, Secondary, Heavy
		- Head, Arms, Chest, Feet, Back
	- Stats
		- Mobility, Recovery, Resilience

- Need a way to authenticate and get the current user information automatically for the authenticated user
	- This includes launching the Bungie sign in page 
	- Listening for page close
	- Getting information from that page after it has closed
- Need a way to search a clan for members and use that information to auto populate a search bar for auto filling fireteam members
- Need a way to remember previous information entered into the search bar
